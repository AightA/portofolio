            <p>I have recently graduated from a 9-month coding bootcamp as a full stack web developer, and I am now
            looking to gain employment in this field.</p>
            <p>
            As an employee, I can offer 10 years’ experience as an electrical and electronics engineer, and I am
            trained in both analogue and digital signal processing. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I have also worked as an engineer and a project
            manager for a major, multinational oil company. </p>
            <p>
            However, I have followed a new career path into
            software development, where I have discovered a new passion for this work and a drive to succeed. 
            </p>
            <p>I
            believe my previous skills and experience will be invaluable as a developer in the future.</p>
